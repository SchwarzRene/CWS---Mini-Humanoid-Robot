## Basic-Concept
The basic idea is to create a robot who is able to collect world data, like audio, video, ... and then send it to a server. This would be useful to train neural networks. The robot should also look like a human and should be able to walk.


## Electronics
The robots has
- 1 x Raspberry Pi Zero 1
- 1 x Raspberry Pi Pico
- 3 x Microphones
- 26 x Servos, 
    - 5 for every leg, 
    - 6 for every arm,
    - 4 for the head
- 1 x LCD-Touchdisplay
- 3 x Accelerometers
- 1 x Humanoid Air Sensor
- 1 x Air Preasure Sensor
- 1 x Compass
- 3 x Tof Sensors
- 1 x Night Vision Camera
- 1 x 20-000 mAh Power Bank
