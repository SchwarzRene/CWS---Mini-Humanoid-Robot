# CWS - Cotschi's Washing Maschine
## CWS-Overview:
CWS is a mini humanoid robot developed for collecting world data and interagating with the world.

## Basic Concept
The basic idea is to create a robot who is able to collect world data, like audio, video, ... and then send it to a server. This would be useful to train neural networks. The robot should be able to walk. The name referse to the first concept because it looked like a washing maschine with legs.


## Electronics
The robots has
- Raspberry Pi Zero 1
- Raspberry Pi Pico
- 3 Microphones
- 25 Servos, 5 for every leg, 6 for every arm and 3 for the head
- A LCD-Touchdisplay
- 3 Accelerometers
- 1 Humanoid Air Sensor
- 1 Compass
- 3 Tof Sensors
- 1 Night Vision Camera
